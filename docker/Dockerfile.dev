# Dockerfile for the Development Environment
#
# This Dockerfile creates a comprehensive development environment.
# It inherits from the 'build' stage of the main Dockerfile
# to ensure a consistent base toolchain, and then adds extra tools
# needed for interactive development.

# Use the 'build' stage from the main Dockerfile as our base.
# This gives us the exact same compiler, libraries, and build tools.
